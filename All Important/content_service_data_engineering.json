          {
            "question": "How long does a typical data platform project take?",
            "answer": "6-12 months for enterprise-scale lakehouse consolidation. We can show you a detailed timeline in the first discovery call based on your specific data volumes and source systems. Smaller projects (single pipeline, specific integration) can be 3-6 months."
          },
          {
            "question": "What's the ROI of a modern data platform?",
            "answer": "Typical clients see 30-40% reduction in storage costs, 50%+ faster time to insights, and 3-5x improvement in data analyst productivity. MSCI saved $12M operationally in the first year. We'll help you build a business case with your specific numbers."
          },
          {
            "question": "Do we need to migrate everything at once?",
            "answer": "No. We typically use a phased approach—critical systems first, then expand. You'll see value within the first 3-4 months while we continue building out the full platform. This reduces risk and lets you validate the approach before full commitment."
          },
          {
            "question": "What happens to our existing data warehouse?",
            "answer": "We run it in parallel during migration, then decommission once validated. Zero disruption to business operations. Most clients see cost savings immediately by retiring legacy infrastructure in phases."
          },
          {
            "question": "Can you work with our existing cloud provider?",
            "answer": "Yes. We're certified on AWS, Azure, and GCP. We meet you where you run and can design multi-cloud architectures if needed. We're also platform-agnostic—we'll recommend what's best for your situation, not what gives us the biggest partnership bonus."
          },
          {
            "question": "What about data security and compliance?",
            "answer": "Security is built in, not bolted on. Every platform includes encryption at rest and in transit, role-based access controls, audit logging, and compliance frameworks (SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR depending on your needs). We're ISO 27001 certified ourselves."
          },
          {
            "question": "How do you handle data quality issues?",
            "answer": "We implement automated data quality checks at every stage—ingestion, transformation, and consumption. Dynatrace observability surfaces issues before they impact downstream users. We typically see 90% reduction in data quality incidents after implementing our framework."
          },
          {
            "question": "What happens after go-live?",
            "answer": "We offer flexible support options: full managed services, co-managed with your team, or complete knowledge transfer. Most clients start with co-managed support for 3-6 months, then transition to their internal team with our architects available for escalations."
